# Coding the bot

For this, we need to create a folder for our code

1. Create a folder, then open a terminal and navigate there
```shell
$ cd path/to/folder
```

2. Then, install discord.js npm library into your project
```shell
$ npm install discord.js
```

3. Create an index.js file on your folder
```shell
touch index.js
```
(Or you can use any file explorer app)

4. Open the file in your favorite code editor

## Starting coding

First of all, we need to import the library into our script, for this:
```js
const Discord = require('discord.js');
```

Then, we create a client:
```js
const client = new Discord.Client();
```

Now, we need to listen when the bot is ready, this an event:
```js
client.once('ready', () => {
    console.log('Ready!');
})
```

Then, we login with the bot's token:
```js
client.login('your-token-goes-here');
```

But what's a token, a token is a string, that allows to access the bot from the code, you find it in the bot section of your app in Discord Developer Portal:

![Bot Section](./bot_section_token.png "Bot Token")

Click the copy button in the token, then paste it in `client.login('token')`

So, if you created a server, let's add the bot to that server, for that we use an bot invitation link
```
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id={clientID}&scope=bot
```

You have to replace the clientID part with your bot's client ID, which can be found in the main page of your application in Discord Developer Portal

![Bot Main Page](./bot_main_page.png "Bot Main Page")

Find and copy the CLIENT ID in that page    
Then replace the `{clientID}` part in the above link, and open the link

It will show you something like this:

![Bot Auth](./bot_auth.png "Bot Auth")

Select the server that you want to add your bot in the dropdown, and click "Authorize"  
It will ask you for a captcha, complete it  
Then go to your server, and you will find the bot in the right hand section     
Now, go to your terminal and start the bot: 
```shell
$ node index.js
```

I recommend using "Nodemon" a npm library that "nodes" the app everytime there's a change, for that:
```shell
$ npm install nodemon -g
```

So, after you see in the console the "Ready!" message, it means that our bot is ready   
You should see your bot online

![Bot Online](./bot_online.png "Bot Is Online")

(Alyx is you, and "Bot-Bot" represents your bot)

## Hooray!

ðŸŽ‰ Congrats!

You now have a bot up & running
